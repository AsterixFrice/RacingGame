| 2        | Build the player + stat data structure (including mood)                        | Code   |
| 3        | Design and code training logic (stat gains, mood effects, failure rates)       | Both   |
| 4        | Create basic `StoryMode()` character select screen                             | Code   |
| 5        | Plan and build basic race simulation system (tick/step system, stat influence) | Both   |
| 6        | Create basic HUD function for Training Menu (stat/mood/time display)           | Code   |
| 7        | Define how mood works numerically and affects outcomes                         | Design |
| 8        | Stub out race day behavior gate (`if day == race day`)                         | Code   |
| 9        | Connect race results to the existing GIF generator                             | Code   |

| 14       | Clean up `ChoiceDic` to point to functions directly (not string names)         | Code   |
| 15       | Fix spacing and variable clarity in menu code (e.g. `choice_input `)           | Code   |
| 16       | Standardize `input("Press Enter to continue.")` feedback messages              | Code   |
