# Structure of the game.

- Check save file to mark character with previous games and best score. 

2. Adventure mode.
- Player can name the racer and the game features random stats. 
- Currently under review. 
- Can be implemented easily afterwards by switching pre-defined character by a random generator. 

3. Hall of Fame.
- Record of past games. 
- Tracks best ranking for each story mode character. 
- Create function that checks if save file exists. If not create one with 0 in everything. Otherwise load up existing one. 

4. Exit.


## Story Mode. 

Step 1. 
Player picks a player from a list. 
Current list include Frice, Vita, Ami, Leggy, Nazo and Trip.
    To do: 
        Define strengths and weaknesses for each character.


### Stats:

Different characters are expected to have different values, these values can be inspected by the player (either only the player character or all of them before a race).
Variable Stats:
- Speed.
    - Affects top speed. Relevant when stamina isn't 0. 
- Stamina. 
    - Affects how stamina is lost over the course of a race. 
- Guts. 
    - Affects speed when stamina is zero. 
    - Represents a percentage of max speed.
- Footing. 
    - Affects odds of suffering speed loss from the track terrain and receiving injuries. 

Affects all characters. 
Fix Stats: 
- Start the race with a max of 3 stamina. 
- Start the race with no injuries.

Step 2. 
Player is presented with the Training menu.

### Training menu. 

- HUD. 
 - Date / time until next race.
 - Horse Stats.
 - Mood. 

- Menu. 
 - Pick a training program. 
  - Basic training (one stat)
  - Advanced training (more than 1 stat, more likely to 'fail' or receive limited results)
  - Rest (improve mood which affects success in training and race.)
 - Check stats for next race (weather, race track and some/all rivals for the race). 
- If day == race day, block all the other options and present 'race' option. 


Step 3.
Player is given a detailed gif and turn by turn view of the race and its results. 
- Program to generate gif is already made, requires iteration but can be used currently as long as the input is similar. 

Step 4. 
Results: 
- There's a list of winners and a minor character text about the event. 
    - Text is based on an array of options, covering different positions and picked at random.  

Step 5. 
Return to the training menu, step 2. 

Step 6. 
After enough races, reach the end of this mode and outline all the races and results, granting one final score. 

Step 7. 
Save results and add a value (a star) depending on the final ranking. 
    - This means implementing a save feature.  

Expected game time: 10-15 minutes (if I'm lucky). 


## characters

In the story mode, several characters can be picked, with their unique starting points. 
Due to the early state of the game, balance will be kept a low priority.

Pseudo-code: 
    Class Racer(input):
        self.[Stat] = (Int) (repeat as many times as relevant)
        self.Stamina = 3 (Reset at the start of the race)
        self.[Stat]Stat = (Int) (Non player characters receive stat/#stats per race)
